A note to Mr.Zamansky:

When you run the game using gui, please use GuiRedo.java (the other one is backup scrap from a few weeks ago)
We also created a Driver (courtesy of Florence) which is more detailed and accurate, so give that a whirl too please. 

My apologies for not making your card :( If you can wait until after the history regents, I'll be sure to put it on github by tomorrow. 


GAME:
In simple terms, it's  http://www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=1182&size=regular&quality=high&play=true 

In our game, cards (with pictures of students/teachers/random characters) each have 5 traits: bravery, likability, enthusiasm, charima, and wisdom. The player will choose one trait and compare it with the enemy's card's trait. If the traits are equal, both players lose that card and it goes into a tied pile. If the player wins, it he/she keeps her cards and wins the tied pile. If the AI wins, the player loses his/her card and the AI also wins the tied pile. 

Things NOT working/want to try work on more
       -GuiRedo.java--> needs a lot of tweeking and more details, but it's functioning.
       -Driver.java-->Refill works, but you'll never have less than 10 cards
       -Cards themselves-->I wanted to make more cards, but who has the time. -elou
